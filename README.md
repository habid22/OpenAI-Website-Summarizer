# AI Website Summarizer
## This project was created using React, Vite, TailwindCSS and OpenAI API

I designed, developed, and brought to life a dynamic website utilizing JavaScript, React, Tailwind, and Vite technologies. This innovative platform is capable of summarizing a wide range of web content. By integrating OpenAI's API, I harnessed cutting-edge language processing capabilities, enabling the automatic summarization of content from any given web page. Through meticulous design with React, I crafted an intuitive and responsive user interface, ensuring a seamless experience for users submitting URLs and receiving concise content summaries. To enhance the website's aesthetics and usability, I employed Tailwind CSS, implementing a modern and visually appealing design. Additionally, I optimized data fetching and state management with RTK (Redux Toolkit), ensuring smooth and responsive user interactions throughout the platform.
